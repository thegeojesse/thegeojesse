- Hi I'm @thegeojesse,
- I am a postdoctoral research associate at Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
- My research involves the chemistry and conditions of metamorphism in the deep Earth, with focuses on redox processes, sulfur chemistry, and geochronology. 
- I regularly develop codes for processing and visualizing data, which I hope to share here on github
